在家做最简单的实验（真空和断续的做不了），传v2beach.cn代码(oss, tomcat, nginx, nodejs)，把5次传上去

传的代码写readme；改user.email，一年半了才他妈发现，我说怎么所有commit都不算contribution，原来是因为For me this problem was caused by me committing from my work computer where I was using a different email in my gitconfig. Adding my work email address to my github account didn't make the past commits show up in the summary, but new commits are now showing up as they should.

You can find the email address you are using for a repository with git config user.email.

There are two leading theories about how siphons cause liquid to flow uphill, against gravity, without being pumped, and powered only by gravity. The traditional theory for centuries was that gravity pulling the liquid down on the exit side of the siphon resulted in reduced pressure at the top of the siphon. Then atmospheric pressure was able to push the liquid from the upper reservoir, up into the reduced pressure at the top of the siphon, like in a barometer or drinking straw, and then over. However, it has been demonstrated that siphons can operate in a vacuum and to heights exceeding the barometric height of the liquid. Consequently, the cohesion tension theory of siphon operation has been advocated, where the liquid is pulled over the siphon in a way similar to the chain fountain. It need not be one theory or the other that is correct, but rather both theories may be correct in different circumstances of ambient pressure. The atmospheric pressure with gravity theory cannot explain siphons in vacuum, where there is no significant atmospheric pressure. But the cohesion tension with gravity theory cannot explain CO2 gas siphons, siphons working despite bubbles, and the flying droplet siphon, where gases do not exert significant pulling forces, and liquids not in contact cannot exert a cohesive tension force.
