2009 autumn https://www.scs.stanford.edu/09au-cs144/sched/

每年新的课程都会不太一样，我选择学的是[Philip Levis](https://online.stanford.edu/instructors/philip-levis) and [Nick McKeown](https://online.stanford.edu/instructors/nick-mckeown)的版本，是youtube上比较全的2012年前后的版本。

课件也会用当时的，比较重要的lab我选做新的https://cs144.github.io 。毕竟连[cs144自个的syllabus](https://cs144.github.io/logistics.pdf)都说了，这门课的重心是lab。

CS144 is a lab-based systems course: 45% of your grade is based the programming lab in C++, which means you need to be very comfortable with C++ and using standard debugging tools (if you are reading through thousands of lines of printf output you are doing something wrong).

重学完Computer Networking再重学一下OS，本科都有些走马观花。
