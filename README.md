这是关于我个人对各种问题的认识的百科（小抄），有人感兴趣的话当然可以在[这个repo](https://github.com/V2beach/v2beach.github.io)共同编辑。

结构是，

/Tech是随意的科学技术笔记。

/Algorithm是对算法的理解。

/Hybrid是上面的补集。ChatGPT说a hybrid can be made of more than two things就用了。

/Language consists of notes about English, עִבְרִית, $ProgrammingLanguage, and maybe other foreign languages.

>'Contains' means something may include a particular thing but there may be other things also present in it. 'Consists' means that a particular thing has only these many things present in it. Apart from them nothing else is present.

/Log是我的chip log，收容在这儿是由于现在不像多年前写得那么频繁，也不想放到太显眼的位置。

postscript(p.s.), 有时我会把gitbook的笔记当成博客的草稿。
