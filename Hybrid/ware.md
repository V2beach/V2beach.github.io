Hardware refers to the physical components of a system, such as the motherboard, processor, memory, hard drive, etc.

Firmware is stored in read-only memory (ROM) and is responsible for booting the system and low-level tasks.

Software is stored in random access memory (RAM) and can be executed by the processor.
