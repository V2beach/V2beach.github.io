The piano is generally considered to be both a stringed and a percussion instrument. 因为发声原理是弦槌撞击琴弦震动，所以钢琴同时属于弦乐器和打击乐器。

一般来说交响乐团只有管弦乐器，有钢琴的通常是协奏曲。

damper = damp(late 14c., "to suffocate"闷死, a device that stops a piano string from making a sound, that can be stopped from working by pressing a key or pedal踏板) + er,
